/*
System.out.println("a");
System.out.println("b");

///*
System.out.println("//");
//System.out.println("//");

Output:
//

Explanation:
Lines 2-5 are commented out by a block comment.
Lines 6 and 9 are not a block comment since both are commented out by // before the /* and */.
Therefore, lines 7 and 8 are not in a block comment.
Line 7 prints "//".
Line 8 is commented out by // (a line comment).

System.out.println(5 / 2);
System.out.println(5 / 2.0);
System.out.println(5.0 / 2);
System.out.println(5.0 / 2.0);
System.out.println(5 * 2);
System.out.println(5 * 2.0);
System.out.println(5.0 * 2);
System.out.println(5.0 * 2.0);
System.out.println(5 % 2);
System.out.println(6 % 2);
System.out.println(-9 % 2);
System.out.println(5 % 1.4);
System.out.println(5.6 % 1.9);

Notes:
5 / 2 is integer division, while 5 / 2.0, 5.0 / 2, and 5.0 / 2.0 are not integer division.
Similar reasoning for the multiplication.
-9 % 2 is -1 since if the first operand of % is negative then the result is negative.
Note that the last two have a little bit of imprecision, and that any non-integer computation can have imprecision.

System.out.println("1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1);
System.out.println("1 + 1 = " + (1 + 1));
System.out.println(1 + 1);
System.out.println("2 * 3 = " + 2 * 3);
System.out.println("7 / 2 = " + 7 / 2);
System.out.println(1 + 1 + " = 1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1);
System.out.println(1 + 2 * 5 % 3 - 6);

Output:
1 + 1 = 11
1 + 1 = 2
2
2 * 3 = 6
7 / 2 = 3
2 = 1 + 1 = 11
-4

Notes:
On line 60 addition goes from left to right, so "1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1 is "1 + 1 = 1" + 1, which is "1 + 1 = 11"
On line 61, the expression in parentheses is computed first.
On lines 63 and 64, * and / come before + in the order of operations.
Line 65 is computed the following way:
1 + 1 + " = 1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1
2 + " = 1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1
"2 = 1 + 1 = " + 1 + 1
"2 = 1 + 1 = 1" + 1
"2 = 1 + 1 = 11"
On line 66, * and % have the same priority (above + and -). Therefore,
1 + 2 * 5 % 3 - 6 = 1 + 10 % 3 - 6 = 1 + 1 - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4.

Original code:
Public class 2FullOfErrors
{
  system.out.Println("qwerty");
  public void main(String args)
  {
    System.println("asdfgh");
}
System.out.println(zxcvbn);
System.out.println("1 + 1 = " (1 + 1));

Fixed code:
public class TooFullOfErrors
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("qwerty");
        System.out.println("asdfgh");
        System.out.println("zxcvbn");
        System.out.println("1 + 1 = " + (1 + 1));
    }
}

Errors fixed:
public is lowercase.
The class name cannot start with a number.
All statements must be inside the main method.
The main method needs a static and is missing [] after String.
A } is missing.
A + is missing between "1 + 1 = " and (1 + 1).
System is uppercase.
println is lowercase.
An out is missing between one of the System and println.
zxcvbn needs to be in quotes.
